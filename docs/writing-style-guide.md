## ü§ñ **Smart Style Recommendations**

Our extension analyzes your project context to recommend the best writing style:

### üîç **Analysis Factors**
- **Package.json keywords**: Detects "enterprise", "business", "consumer", "developer"
- **Repository patterns**: Checks for compliance docs, user-facing apps, dev tools
- **Commit patterns**: Analyzes typical commit message formality
- **Team size**: Considers contributor count and collaboration patterns

### üìã **Recommendation Logic**

```typescript
// Formal Style Indicators
- package.json contains: "enterprise", "compliance", "banking", "healthcare"
- Has files: COMPLIANCE.md, SECURITY.md, AUDIT.md
- Long commit messages with formal language
- Large team with strict PR processes

// Dev-Friendly Style Indicators  
- package.json contains: "cli", "framework", "library", "developer-tools"
- Has files: CONTRIBUTING.md, API.md, technical documentation
- Conventional commits with technical details
- Active open-source community

// PM-Style Indicators
- package.json contains: "app", "mobile", "web", "user", "consumer"
- Has files: ROADMAP.md, user-facing documentation
- Simple, user-focused commit messages
- Product-oriented repository structure
```

### üéØ **Quick Decision Guide**

**Choose Formal if:**
- Your software handles sensitive data (finance, healthcare, legal)
- You need regulatory compliance documentation
- Your audience includes executives or compliance officers
- You work in enterprise B2B environments

**Choose Dev-Friendly if:**
- You're building developer tools, APIs, or frameworks
- Your primary audience is other developers
- You maintain open-source projects
- Technical accuracy is more important than accessibility

**Choose PM-Style if:**
- You're building consumer applications
- Your changelog will be shown to end users
- You need to communicate value to non-technical stakeholders
- You're focusing on user benefits over implementation details

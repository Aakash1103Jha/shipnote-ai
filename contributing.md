# ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! ShipNote AI is built with love by the community, for the community.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**  
   Click the "Fork" button on GitHub to create your own copy

2. **Clone your fork**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shipnote-ai.git
   cd shipnote-ai
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch**  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

## Development Workflow

We follow **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** practices:

1. **Write tests first** - Define the expected behavior
2. **Watch tests fail** - Ensure your test actually tests something
3. **Implement the minimum code** - Make the tests pass
4. **Refactor** - Improve the code while keeping tests green
5. **Repeat** - For each new piece of functionality

### Example TDD Workflow
```bash
# 1. Write a failing test
npm test -- --grep "your feature"

# 2. Implement the feature
# Edit the source files

# 3. Verify tests pass
npm test

# 4. Run all tests to ensure no regressions
npm test
```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Quality
- **Follow TDD practices** - write tests first!
- **Maintain 100% test coverage** for new features
- **Use TypeScript** - leverage type safety
- **Follow ESLint rules** - run `npm run lint`
- **Update documentation** for user-facing changes

### Commit Messages
Use **conventional commits** for clear history:

```bash
feat: add style recommendation caching
fix: resolve OpenAI API timeout issues
docs: update installation guide
test: add edge cases for changelog generation
refactor: improve error handling in git service
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure all tests pass**  
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Update documentation**  
   - README.md if adding user-facing features
   - JSDoc comments for new public APIs
   - Update relevant docs/ files

3. **Create a clear PR description**  
   - What does this change do?
   - Why is this change needed?
   - How has it been tested?

4. **Link related issues**  
   Use "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #456"
